# LUR_PostGIS
###PostGIS scripts for Land Use Regression (LUR). Generate the LUR variables as seen in pretty much every LUR study. 

- See Eeftens et al. (2012) for more info on specific variables - Environ. Sci. Technol., 2012, 46 (20), pp 11195â€“11205 DOI: 10.1021/es301948k

- Required files are point locations of receptors, land cover polygons (usually CORINE), road geography with traffic flows (AADT), postcode centroids with population and number of households. These files need to be imported into PostGIS and the relevant filenames renamed in the DECLARE section of each SQL script.
